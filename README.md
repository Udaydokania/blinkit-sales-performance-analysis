# Blinkit Sales Performance Analysis 🛒📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive evaluation of Blinkit’s sales performance using Python-based data analysis. The study aims to uncover patterns in outlet operations, item visibility, and revenue distribution across various outlet sizes and geographic locations to drive better business decision-making.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 🧪 Data Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning:** Standardized categorical labels (e.g., fixing "low fat" inconsistencies) and verified data types to ensure statistical accuracy.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed a deep dive into outlet establishment trends and sales distributions using count plots and histograms.
3. **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluated sales performance based on **Outlet Size** (Small, Medium, High) and **Location Tier** (Tier 1, 2, 3).
4. **Visual Storytelling:** Developed pie charts and bar graphs to visualize revenue contributors and outlet growth over time.

## 📈 Key Business Insights
- **Establishment Trends:** Total sales show a notable peak for outlets established around **2015**, indicating a high-performing vintage for store growth.
- **Outlet Size Dominance:** **Medium-sized outlets** are the primary revenue drivers, contributing significantly more to total sales compared to "High" or "Small" categories.
- **Location Performance:** Sales are distributed across Tier 1, 2, and 3 cities, providing a clear roadmap for regional expansion and resource allocation.
