# Blinkit Sales Performance Analysis 🛒📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive evaluation of Blinkit’s sales performance using Python-based data analysis. The study aims to uncover hidden patterns in outlet operations, item visibility, and revenue distribution across various outlet sizes and geographic locations to drive better business decision-making.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📖 Data Dictionary
The analysis is performed on a retail dataset containing the following key attributes:
| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Item Identifier** | Unique ID assigned to each product. |
| **Item Fat Content** | Categorization of the product based on fat levels (Regular/Low Fat). |
| **Item Type** | The category to which the product belongs (e.g., Fruits, Household). |
| **Outlet Identifier** | Unique ID for each specific store/outlet. |
| **Outlet Establishment Year** | The year the outlet was founded. |
| **Outlet Size** | The ground area coverage of the outlet (Small, Medium, High). |
| **Outlet Location Type** | Tier-based categorization of the city where the outlet is located. |
| **Sales** | Total revenue generated by the item in the specific outlet. |

## 🧹 Data Ingestion & Preprocessing (Day 2 Update)
The second phase focused on auditing and cleaning the raw data to ensure analytical accuracy:
- **Dataset Loading:** Successfully ingested the `blinkit_data.csv` using the Pandas library.
- **Standardization:** Identified inconsistencies in categorical labels, such as "low fat" vs "Low Fat," and standardized them for accurate grouping.
- **Integrity Check:** Performed an initial inspection of the dataset structure using `.head(10)` and `.info()` to identify null values and data types.
- **Exploratory Preparation:** Categorized outlets into Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations to facilitate comparative regional analysis.
